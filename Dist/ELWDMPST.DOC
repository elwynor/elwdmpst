 WHAT IS ANNOUNCER?

 Announcer is a basic utility that gives you the ability to send global
 broadcasts to users you select by key at intervals you choose. This version
 supports one broadcast message. You will definitely want to edit this message
 right away in CNF.

 You control who gets the broadcast by key; the default is that only DEMO users
 get them, but if you change the key to SUPER for example, everyone but those
 with the SUPER key will get the broadcasts. You also choose how many seconds
 come between broadcasts. All of this is configurable in CNF.

 CONFIGURATION

 In LEVEL3, you can set what key is required to NOT be pestered.
 
 In LEVEL4, you can set the interval in seconds between pesters, whether the
 message beeps the user, and whether or not to pester users in the Editor.
 
 In LEVEL6, you can configure the pestering message!
 
 INSTALLATION AND ACTIVATION
 
 Simply unzip the archive to your BBS server directory, add 
 it to your menu, configure the MSG file to your liking, and start 
 the BBS!  It's that easy! 

 MODULE HISTORY
 
 Announcer was written in January 1995 by "Easy Ed" Erdman of EzSoft. The
 module was available as a free module up through Worldgroup 3.0. 
 
 EzSoft was acquired by AdventureComm, which was acquired by Elwynor 
 Technologies in 2004.

 Elwynor Technologies ported the module to Worldgroup 3.2 in May 2021, and
 converted it to Major BBS V10 in July 2024.
